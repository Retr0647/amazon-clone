# Amazon Website Clone

![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-brightgreen)

# Project Description

This project is a visual and interactive clone of Amazon Website. It is build with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The project is originally from a youtube course video for JavaScript from a youtuber SuperSimpleDev.
Here is a link for this course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerdGm-ehJQ&t=15s
I followed this 22 hours long course and made it from scratch in VS Code. 
The idea of this project was to learn JavaScript and practice HTML and CSS.

# Features 

1. Main page with all the products, which are imported from a web server, that you can add to the cart in
  different quantities and a working search-bar.
2. Second page which is the checkout page, where you can remove or add more items to the cart and you can
   see when the order is gonna arive as well as how much it will cost with or without the delivery.
3. Third page which is the orders page, where you can see how far along your order in the delivery process.
4. A testing environment that uses Jasmine to check most of the functions that are used in the project.
5. A full documentation of all the functions explaining what they are doing.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Retr0647/amazon-clone.git
cd your-repo
npm install
npm start
```

# Usage 

After installing the project on your device you can open the main site to use it freely.
If you want to make the tests for the functions you will need to open the HTML file for
Jasmine titled "tests.html". To see what each function does check the documentation.
